## Introduction
Welcome to my Citi Bike Data Analysis project! In this project, I utilized Python for data processing and Tableau for creating insightful visualizations and reports based on the Citi Bike program data.

The Citi Bike program is a bike-sharing initiative in New York City that provides a sustainable and convenient transportation option for residents and visitors. The goal of this project was to analyze the data from the Citi Bike program and present key findings through interactive visualizations using Tableau.

## Data Preparation
To start the project, I used Python and the Pandas library to clean and combine the Citi Bike data covering the period from January 2018 to December 2020. The data was collected monthly and stored in separate CSV files. The steps included:

Loading each monthly CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Appending these DataFrames to create a single DataFrame containing data for the entire year.
Cleaning the data by addressing any inconsistencies, missing values, or anomalies.
The cleaned and combined data was then saved as a CSV file named citibike.csv.
Please note that the large size of the CSV files precludes their storage in this repository and in GitHub's Large File Storage.

# Dashboards
Homepage
The project encompasses a homepage and three interconnected dashboards that provide a holistic understanding of the Citi Bike program's dynamics. The homepage serves as an introduction, offering a concise summary of each dashboard's key findings, facilitating swift navigation to areas of interest.

User Analysis
This dashboard delves into user-based analyses, exploring aspects like user type, gender distribution, and age demographics. Additionally, it scrutinizes time-related patterns, including hourly and daily trends, while offering insights into the monthly trajectory of total trips.

Station Analysis
Focused on station-centric insights, this dashboard compares weekday and weekend trends in relation to start and end stations. It further uncovers variations in average trip durations across months.

Geographic Analysis
Presenting geographic insights, this dashboard showcases two maps highlighting start and end station locations. Utilizing marker size and color, it visually represents trip frequency, thus aiding in understanding spatial utilization patterns.

Usage
To explore the interactive dashboards and gain insights from this project, follow these steps:

Access the Tableau Public workbook: Citibike

Navigate through the dashboards by clicking on their respective tabs. Each visualization offers filters, tooltips, and interactions that enable a deeper exploration of the data.

Hover over data points, select filters, and click on specific elements to uncover more detailed information about Citi Bike program dynamics.

Summary
Upon analyzing the data spanning 2018 to 2020, we've observed significant insights:

Trips Decline: There was a 4.83% decrease in trips over the three-year period, attributed to COVID-19-related factors.
User Dynamics Shift: While subscribers decreased by 30.20%, customer numbers surged by 374.90%, reflecting pandemic influences.
Gender Trends: The number of female riders increased by 12.55%, while male riders decreased by 22.29%.
Peak Usage: Peak utilization occurred during weekdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., likely driven by commuting needs.
These findings offer a glimpse into the program's dynamic nature, influenced by various factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

Conclusion
This project's Tableau analysis has shed light on intricate usage patterns and trends within the Citi Bike program. The visualizations and insights showcased here not only inform decision-making for program enhancements but also encourage further exploration and research into the data. I hope that this analysis serves as a valuable resource for those interested in understanding the dynamics of the Citi Bike program.
