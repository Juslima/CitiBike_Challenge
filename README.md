## Introduction
Welcome to my Citi Bike Data Analysis project! In this project, I utilized Python for data processing and Tableau for creating insightful visualizations and reports based on the Citi Bike program data.

The Citi Bike program is a bike-sharing initiative in New York City that provides a sustainable and convenient transportation option for residents and visitors. The goal of this project was to analyze the data from the Citi Bike program and present key findings through interactive visualizations using Tableau.

## Data Preparation
To start the project, I used Python and the Pandas library to clean and combine the Citi Bike data for the year 2023. The data was collected monthly and stored in separate CSV files. The steps included:

Loading each monthly CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Appending these DataFrames to create a single DataFrame containing data for the entire year.
Cleaning the data by addressing any inconsistencies, missing values, or anomalies.
The cleaned and combined data was then saved as a CSV file named CitiBike.csv.

## Tableau Workbook: CitiBike_challenge
I created a Tableau workbook named "CitiBike_challenge" to visualize and analyze the Citi Bike program data. The workbook includes multiple interactive dashboards and visualizations to provide insights into the program's utilization and patterns. Here's an overview of the visualizations:

1. Overview Dashboard: This dashboard provides a high-level overview of the program's performance, including total rides, rideable types, and user types (members vs. casual riders).
2. Monthly Trends: Visualizations in this section showcase the monthly trends in ride volume, popular start and end stations, and average ride duration.
3. User Analysis: This dashboard focuses on user behavior, highlighting differences between members and casual riders. It includes metrics like average trip distance, top start and end stations for each user type, and ride distribution by age.
4. Geospatial Analysis: Interactive maps display the distribution of start and end stations across the city, revealing the most popular biking routes.
5. Peak Hours and Days: This visualization highlights the busiest hours and days of the week for the Citi Bike program.

## Usage
To explore the visualizations and insights from this project, follow these steps:

1. Access the Tableau workbook: CitiBike_challenge
2. Navigate through the dashboards and visualizations to gain insights into the Citi Bike program's utilization, user patterns, and trends.
3. Interact with the visualizations by hovering over data points, filtering, and selecting to uncover more detailed information.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the power of data analysis and visualization in understanding the utilization and patterns of the Citi Bike program. The Tableau workbook provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the data and gaining valuable insights that can inform decisions for program improvements and expansions.
